Alignment sources:
    1. amine from Spielman, Kumar, Wilke (2014) PeerJ, with just the transmembrane regions of the alignment concatenated together
    2. pb2 from Tamuri et al 2014, and other papers in this "group"
    3. camelid, COXI, and lysin are from the CodonTest 2010 paper
    4. ATP-cone, NADH5_C, Transketolase, and YAL038W are from the Synonymous rate variation 2005 paper.
