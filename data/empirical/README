Alignment sources:
    1. amine from Spielman, Kumar, Wilke (2014) PeerJ, with just the transmembrane regions of the alignment concatenated together
    2. pb2 from Tamuri et al 2014, and other papers in this "group"
    3. Rest are from PANDIT. See directory pandit_processing/ for details.
    
All phylogenies (except pb2, which was directly taken) were built with RAxML v8.?? under the GTR+CAT model.
