Alignment sources:
    1. pb2 alignment from Tamuri et al 2014, and other papers in this "group"
    2. All PFAM alignments were collected from PANDIT database using code in ../../scripts/empirical_data_collection/query_pandit.py 
    
    
All phylogenies (except pb2, which was directly taken) were built with RAxML v8.1 under the GTR+CAT model.
